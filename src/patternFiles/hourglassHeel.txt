Hourglass Heel
Adapted from Kat Haines' Tessellating Lace Socks

Heel:
			Work the heel flap over the first half of the sts. The second half are held for the instep.
			*Note: If using dpns, knit one more round of the leg, dividing stitches as follows:
				- 1st half (<halfSts> sts) onto needle one
				- 2nd half divided evenly on remaining needles (<quarterSts> sts per needle for 3 dpns)

			int activeSts=<halfSts>;
			int row = 2;
			System.out.println(Row 1: (RS) K<halfSts>, turn);
			do {
				if(<activeSts>%2 == 0){
					System.out.println(Row <row>: YO purl wise, purl <activeSts>, turn);
				}else{
					System.out.println(Row <row>: YO knit wise, knit <activeSts>, turn);
				}
				<activeSts>--;
				<row>++;
			} while (activeSts >= 2*<halfSts>/3);
