Default Cuff
Cuff:		
			Cast on <castOn> sts with size <largerNeedle> needles
			Divide evenly over dpns: <3dpns> per needle for 3 dpns
			Join in the round
			Work ribbing for 1.5”: <cuffRows> rows			
Ribbing: 	k<ribK>, p<ribP> to end of round

Default Leg
Leg:
			Switch to size <smallerNeedle> needles 
			Work St st for 3.5": <legRows> rows
			Or until leg is desired length, ending just above the ankle bone.
			
Default HeelFlap
Heel Flap:
			Work the heel flap over the first half of the sts. The second half are held for the instep.
			*Note: If using dpns, knit one more round of the leg, dividing stitches as follows:
				- 1st half (<halfSts> sts) onto needle one
				- 2nd half divided evenly on remaining needles (<quarterSts> sts per needle for 3 dpns)

			Setup Row: K first half of sts: (<halfSts>) sts
			Row 1: (wrong side) Sl1, p1 to end of row
			Row 2: (right side) *Sl1, k1* Repeat between * to end of row
			Rep rows 1&2 <instepRows> more times (<instepRowsPlus1> times total). End after a right side (knit) row
			
			
Default HeelTurn
//TODO: Write proper method
HeelTurn:			
			Row 1: (WS) Sl1, p<Y>, p2, p2tog, p1, turn
			Row 2: Sl1, k<row + 2>, ssk, k1, turn
			Row 3: Sl1, p<row + 2>, p2tog, p1, turn
			Row 4: Sl1, k<row + 2>, ssk, k1, turn
			Con’t in this manner until no sts remain after the gap, ending with a RS row. You may have to end with a ask without the k1. Do NOT turn.
			
			//Heel turn pseudo code
			Row 1 is special, write that one
			for(int row = 2; row<=??; row++){
				print:
					"Row " + row + ": Sl1, ";
				if(row is even){
					print:
						 "k" + (Z) + ", ssk, k1, turn";
				}else{
				//row is odd
					print:
						"p" + (Z) + ", p2tog, p1, turn";
				}
				Z += 1;
			}
				
Default Gusset
Gusset:
			Row 1: 
				Pick up and knit sl sts on each side of the heel flap (<halfInstepRows> sts from each side).
				If using circular needles, place stitch markers between the picked up sts and sts held in reserve as you knit this row
			Odd rows: K
			With 3 dpns:
				Even rows: 
					Needle 1: K to last 3 stitches, k2tog
					Needle 2: K
					Needle 3: K1, ssk, k to end
			With circular needles:
				Even rows:
					K to 3 sts before first stitch marker, k2tog, k to next stitch marker, k1, ssk, k to end
			Repeat until you are back to <castOn> stitches (<gussetRows> rows)

Default Foot:
Foot:
			K until work measures <lengthEase>
			About <footRows> rows

Default Toe:
Toe:
			With 3 dpns:
				Needle 1: K to last 3 stitches, k2tog
				Needle 2: K1, ssk, k to last 3 stitches, k2tog, k1
				Needle 3: K1, ssk, k to end
			With cicular needles
				K to 3 sts before first stitch marker, k2tog, k2, ssk, k to 3 sts before second stitch marker, k2tog, k2, ssk, k to end
			Con’t in this manner until 10 sts remain, <toeRows> rows
			Graft toe shut (with kitchener stitch, for example) and weave in ends.
