Default Heel Flap

Heel Flap:
			Work the heel flap over the first half of the sts. The second half are held for the instep.
			*Note: If using dpns, knit one more round of the leg, dividing stitches as follows:
				- 1st half (<halfSts> sts) onto needle one
				- 2nd half divided evenly on remaining needles (<quarterSts> sts per needle for 3 dpns)

			Setup Row: K first half of sts: (<halfSts>) sts
			Row 1: (wrong side) Sl1, p1 to end of row
			Row 2: (right side) *Sl1, k1* Repeat between * to end of row
			Rep rows 1&2 <instepRows> more times (<instepRowsPlus1> times total). End after a right side (knit) row
